# RSS2Discord

RSS2Discord is an approach to send an RSS Feed to a Discord Webhook. Idea here is to have a constant update of statuses to but pushed to the Discord Webhook.

In this example we would be using nitter.net which is an alternative to twitter.com / x.com and to get tweets pushed on to Discord.

### Inspiration
This project was inspired by the Tweetshift Discord Bot. Tweetshift is a Discord bot that got tweets from Twitter.com and posted them on any specified Discord channel. As Tweetshift changed their usage only for paid users and the free approach had been discontinued. I took it upon myself to rebuild this functionality with a much minimalistic approach.

Currently the RSS2Discord embed looks very similar to the Tweetshift approach and excludes Retweets as the Tweetshift bot also did by default.
